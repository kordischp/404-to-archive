# 404 to Archive Redirecter  

**A Tampermonkey userscript that detects 404 (Not Found) pages and offers to redirect you to the archived version on Wayback Machine.**  


## Features  
- Detects 404 pages based on HTTP status code 
- Asks for confirmation before redirecting. 

## Installation  
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (if you haven’t already).  
2. Click [here](https://github.com/kordischp/404-to-archive/blob/main/404%20to%20Archive%20Redirecter-0.1.user.js) and then click Raw to install the script.  
3. Enjoy!

## How It Works  
- If a page is detected as a **404**, a popup will ask if you want to visit its archived version.  
- Click **OK** to go to the Wayback Machine, or **Cancel** to stay on the page.
